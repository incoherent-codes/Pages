# A collection of useful tools 

The purpose of this webpage is to collect relevant information for the working flow of our team (mainly focused on beam dynamics of incoherrent effects).

This is a GitHub page created under the [incoherent-codes](http://github.com/incoherent-codes) organization to test how it could look like because birectional repository syncing is not yet there.

Go to: 
[https://incoherent-codes.github.io/codes/](https://incoherent-codes.github.io/codes/) to have a look!
